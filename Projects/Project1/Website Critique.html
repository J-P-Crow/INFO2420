<li><p>My first impression of this site was that is was clean and informative in style.</p></li>
<li><p>The flow of the site is good! They have quick links set in a box on the side with headings they inform you what they all relate to and how the can be helpful.<p> </li>
<li><p>It mostly makes sense. The parts that are confusing are how the break up the main body of the page with promotional links splitting up their beginning paragraph before leading into their place descriptions.<p></li>
<li><p>For the most part, it relates backs to the last question that their promotional links (which include images that link to other articles) break up the page and make it harder to understand.<p></li> 
<li><p>It loaded incredibly quickly! Hardly any wait time at all.<p></li>
<li><p>Text color and size is good but a little bland and doesn't pull the reader's attention. The background color is a light blue&gray and made it easy to read.<p></li>
<li><p>It does have a navigation bar but it's not easy to read because they didn't break it up in any way.<p></li>
<li><p>Yes, almost all the pages are identical.<p></li>
<li><p>The responsive design is pretty good! They collapse nicely and it was still readable and usable.<p></li>
<li><p>Nothing significant stands out to me. It worked well but wasn't entirely pleasing on the eyes and is just plain.<p></li>
